# Weather App

This is a simple weather app, you can add any location in the world and lookup weather condition in the location.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

To run the app simply install node packages with "npm install" command, and "npm run dev" to run the app.




## Note:
The API is currently not responding in trying to fetch the weather details, looks like subscription is required for that.
